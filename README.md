#Advent of Code 2016
My attempts at solving the advent of code (2016) problems. 
Language probably, mostly be Python. 
Last year I couldn't finish all (i merely just got started) but I hope that this year will be different.

Every day a new problem is posted on [the website](http://adventofcode.com/2016).
